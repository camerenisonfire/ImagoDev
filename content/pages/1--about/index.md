Software is still essentially all built by hand -- by people. How does the individual's life reflect into the applications they create? What does it take to craft software well? What does the software show about the ones who create it? How do we improve our knowledge, skills, and design to make better creations?

Imago Dev focuses on exploring these ideas by merging the schools of engineering, art, and design to all live under the roof of software development.
